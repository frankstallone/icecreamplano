      Everyone Wants to Know Where The Dolly Llama Came From
    </h2>
    <p>
      Wellâ€¦ she's a real llama who lives on a beautiful farm in the South of
      France. She brings joy to everyone she meets and had a particularly
      positive impact on Samuel Baroux.
    </p>
    <p>
      Founded by real estate leader, Eric Shomof and European restaurateur and
      entrepreneur, Samuel Baroux, The Dolly Llama made their dream of working
      together into a reality. When these childhood friends turned businessmen
      got together, magic happened!
    </p>
    <p>
      If you know your llama facts, you know that llamas are social, friendly
      and outgoing animals who generally love people! Dolly, the llama from
      Sam's favorite llama farm in the South of France, is all that and more!
    </p>
    <p>
      When looking to put their concept into fruition, Samuel and Eric, agreed
      that Dolly would be the perfect representation for their ice cream and
      waffle brand, bringing all that fun llama spirit into creative dessert
      concoctions, happy customers and great, fun vibes!
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, The Dolly Llama was created, and we've been lucky enough to
      continue to serve up endless amounts of delicious happiness, daily!
    </p>
    <p>
      Since its inception in 2017, The Dolly Llama has dominated LA's waffle
      scene with its own unique take on the Bubble Waffle, in addition to Dolly
      Llama Shakes, Waffle Sticks, and OG liege Waffles and continues to prove
      that all waffles don't need syrup.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not just your traditional dessert shop, it is a destination! With its
      aesthetic flair, interactive environment, and unbeatable desserts, THE
      DOLLY LLAMA attracts customers from all walks of life. Families,
      individuals, date nights, students, our locations truly are magic!
